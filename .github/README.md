## CloudSync - A spigot-bungee handshake.
-----

### Description
-----
```
This plugin currently exists to allow supporting plugins to passthrough BungeeCord commands.
If you are trying to use for example, bungee: friends on your custom item commands, 
you will need this plugin installed onto your BungeeCord server.
```
-----
### Installation
```
1) Once the CloudSync.jar is downloaded, the jar must be placed into your server's plugins folder.
2) Double-check the server's plugins folder for any duplicate CloudSync.jar files, such as CloudSync(1).jar.
3) Delete any found duplicate instances or there will be conflicting errors in the console window.
4) Once this is completed, the server must be restarted to register and enable the plugin.
5) Realize this is a Proxy Plugin and not a Bukkit/Spigot plugin, starting again from step 1.
6) From this point, it is up to you to configure the plugin or join the discord for additional help.
```
