## ItemJoin-Bungee - A spigot-bungee handshake.
-----

### Description
-----
```
This plugin currently exists to allow the ItemJoin plugin to passthrough BungeeCord commands.
If you are trying to use for example, bungee: friends on your custom item commands, 
you will need this plugin installed onto your BungeeCord server.
```
-----
### Installation
```
1) Once the ItemJoin-Bungee.jar is downloaded, the jar must be placed into your 
bungeecord's plugins folder.
2) Double-check the server's plugins folder for any duplicate ItemJoin-Bungee.jar files, 
such as ItemJoin-Bungee(1).jar.
4) Delete any found duplicate instances or there will be conflicting errors in the console window.
5) Once this is completed, the server must be restarted to register and enable the plugin. The plugin
   will then attempt to find your server version and generate a configuration based on the found version.
5) From this point, it is up to you to configure the plugin or join the discord for additional help.
```
